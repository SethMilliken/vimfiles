Javadoc Support
***************


Commenting
==========

*:JavaDocComment*

Eclim provides the :JavaDocComment command which will add or update
the javadoc comments for the element under the cursor.

Note: The insertion of javadoc comments is done externally with Eclipse
  and with that comes a couple caveats (|vim-issues|).


Configuration
=============

Eclim Settings

- org.eclim.user.name - Used as the name portion of the author tag.
  Consult the settings page (|vim-settings|) for more info.

- org.eclim.user.email - Used as the email portion of the author tag.
  Consult the settings page (|vim-settings|) for more info.


Searching
=========

*:JavaDocSearch*

Eclim supports searching of javadocs just like you would search the
source code (|vim-java-search|).

The only difference is that you use :JavaDocSearch instead of
:JavaSearch.

The results will be displayed in a window and you can simply hit
<enter> on an entry to open it using the browser you configured via
g:EclimBrowser (|g-eclimbrowser|).

The locations of the javadocs are determined via your Eclipse
project's .classpath file.  For each library entry you can define a
javadoc attribute that points to the base url of the javadoc (http,
file, etc).

     <attributes>
       <attribute value="http://hibernate.org/hib_docs/v3/api" name="javadoc_location"/>
     </attributes>
   </classpath>
