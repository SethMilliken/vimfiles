Pentadactyl User 1: O wise and all-powerful John-Galt, I beseech you: this command is far too long and complicated for me. What shall I do?
John-Galt: Alas, there was a time when a single man alone could type as many commands as could ten men today, and with greater skill. Men today are weak and indolent! But I am as forgiving as i am powerful; I shall implement a clever shortcut and bestow it upon you, my minions.
Pentadactyl User 2: This command is still too long for me. Can't I use 'jj' instead?
John-Galt: Foolish mortal! 'jj' is an abomination! Suffer a thouand plagues, blights, and hordes of locusts and speak of it no more! *kazaam*
